# Human-Internet-Protocol (HIP)

## Vision
Human-Internet-Protocol(HIP) is a foundational internet protocol redefining digital identity creating a link to real-world government identification to increase internet security. Biometric authentication, cryptographically secure credentials and AI governance. HIP is built to eliminate bot usage, fake identities, toxic content, anonymous abuse, SEO gaming, and more while maintaining strong privacy and civic freedoms for all users globally. No personalised confidential data will be kept within the system through VCs and DIDs. HIP balances verified identity with pseudonymity, as users are real, but not exposed. 

A Human First Internet.

## Motivations
Since 1996, the internet has evolved into a vast ecosystem with over 5 billion users and countless websites, making effective monitoring exceptionally challenging. Unfortunately, a significant portion of this digital landscape is compromised by bots, fake accounts, and automated scripts that undermine the integrity of online interactions. This situation distorts search results, inflates engagement metrics, and perpetuates an unhealthy online environment.

The Human Integrity Project (HIP) addresses these pressing issues by creating a framework that prioritizes participation by genuine, accountable individuals. We advocate for a trusted user community that emphasizes safety and the quality of online services. Current internet regulations are insufficient, particularly in the context of monopolistic practices and the inadequacy of age verification processes on 18+ websites. The prevalence of misleading content, including social media misinformation and unfiltered adult material, can negatively impact vulnerable populations, particularly youth, fostering unhealthy habits and dangerous exposures.

The time has come to replace the flawed systems of the "new internet" with a more robust and accountable alternative. Without prompt action, we risk descending into a chaotic digital landscape where criminal activity, misinformation, and harmful content proliferate unchecked. Establishing HIP is a crucial step toward fostering an internet that upholds safety, accountability, and integrity for all users.

## Core Principles 
- **Accountability**
 : verified identity is required, removal of anonymity and bots
- **Privacy and Security**
 : data encryption end-to-end with user-controlled wallets (SSI)
- **Global Fairness**
 : access for underserved groups and humanitarians (refugees)
- **Civic Utility**
 : internet identity doubles as a civic ID
- **Transparency oversight**
 : public ledgers, AI moderation, strict government access protocols, global health dashboard
 - **HIP Ethics Council**
 : to monitor and consider global digital rights oversight, and correct alignment in GDPR, CCPA and other laws

## Key Features
### Identity & Access
- **Mandatory ID / Passport Verification**
 : Access to the internet requires real-world identity verification using government-issued documents
- **Biometric Verification**
 : Biometric checks for sensitive content, financial transactions or 18+ access, to ensure the correct user is using the correct account
- **Dual Account System**
 : Each user receives one personal and business account both permanent and verified. unless the business closes, also government proof for business as it will be linked to a government work site (UK) 
- **Digital Human Citizenship**
 : internet accounts are digitally linked to a human identity and citizenship status
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCS)**
 : prove attributes like age, citizenships, employment, and user reputation score, without exposing private data
- **Decentralised Identifiers (DIDS)**
 : Assigns unique public keys to identity anchors

### Content Governance
- **Age-Based Content Access**
 : Content is automatically filtered based on verified age (Vc's)
- **Mandatory content categorisation**
 : all data must be tagged with metadata like age rating, content type, moderation flags
- **Smart content metadata**
 : content metadata included DiD'sm reputation score, moderation history, and more
- **Internet Smart Content**
 : flagged misinformation, rage bait, and junk content are automatically deprioritised

### Data & Security
- **Encrypted Data Storage**
 : every user has a U_ID; all sensitive data is encrypted and stored securely referenced by U_ID
- **Unique Identifier (U_ID)**
 : digital fingerprint. anonymous, permanent, and protected unless the user grants permissions
- **Government Access and Oversight**
 : Government access requires legal procedure and is logged into the public ledger
- **Temporary Access Accounts**
 : refugees or displaced persons can receive a time-limited, geo-bound, read-only access account
- **Privacy Tiers**
 : read only vs active participation and use cases.

### XAI & Automation
- **XAI-powered Internet management**
 : detects bots, spam, misinformation, and manipulative behaviour
- **Narrow personalised XAI assistance**
 : flags misinformation, judges source credibility and reputation score and provides safe content recommendations
- **Decentralised Trust Ledger**
 : Open, tamper-proof, blockchain-free audit trail of identity, moderation and government access
- **Global Cyberhealth Dashboard**
 : Real-time stats on bot outbreaks, fake news, misinformation clusters and moderation health
- **Appeal mechanisms**
 : incase of human oversight or AI oversights on flagged/ suspended content

### Reputation & Transparency
- **User Reputation Scores**
 : track moderation incidents, community contributions, trustworthiness and viewable with consent.
- **Lifetime account management**
 : Accounts cannot be deleted; they are only suspended or restricted. Digital footprints are permanent and monitored
- **Accountability Reversibility**
 : suspended users can undergo digital rehabilitation to mitigate further suspensions and bans.

### Integrity & Participation
- **Links to education and work**
 : verified IDs connect to credentials, degrees, workplaces, and certificates
- **Civic participation tools**
 : enables voting, public forums, petitions, and policy engagement through HIP ID
- **Digital Onboarding Courses**
 : required training on digital ethics, safety, consent, misinformation and privacy
- **Cross-Platform API integration**
 : integration with existing platforms via API tokens for login, reputation verification, content flags & HIP

## Problems Solved
- Fake accounts and identity fraud
- bot manipulation of public metrics
- children exposed to sensitive content
- platform manipulation via throwaway accounts
- unregulated anonymity and trolling
- barriers to education or civic engagement for the displaced
- trustworthiness of the internet and data
- verifiable information access

## Use Cases
**Scenario 1:** Underage user access attempt
- Content blocked based on verified age

**Scenario 2:** Bot Network Creation
- Blocked By ID verification, and AI behaviour analysis resulting in suspension of the creator

**Scenario 3:** Misinformation Campaign
- Flagged by smart metadata and reputation analysis

**Scenario 4:** SEO or click Fraud by bots
- shut down by AI detectors and pattern recognition, also suspends accounts for suspicious activity

**Scenario 5:** Refugee Needs temporary internet access
- granted geo/time-limited, read-only access

## Future Vision
- **At Birth Digital ID Registration**
 : integrated with national identity systems
- **Hardware ID Devices**
 : Portable, biometric hardware for tamper-resistant login
- **Global Governance Collaboration**
 : international compliance frameworks for ethical data and ID usage
