# Human-Internet-Protocol (HIP)

## Vision
HIP is a foundational internet protocol redefining digital identity creating a link to real-world government identification to increase internet security. Biometric authentication, cryptographically secure credentials and AI governance. HIP is built to eliminate bot usage, fake identities, toxic content, anonymous abuse, SEO gaming, and more while maintaining strong privacy and civic freedoms for all users globally. No personalised confidential data will be kept within the system through VCs and DIDs. HIP balances verified identity with pseudonymity, as users are real, but not exposed.

## Core Principles 
- **Accountability**
 : verified identity is required, removal of anonymity and bots
- **Privacy and Security**
 : data encryption end-to-end with user-controlled wallets (SSI)
- **Global Fairness**
 : access for underserved groups and humanitarians (refugees)
- **Civic Utility**
 : internet identity doubles as a civic ID
- **Transparency oversight**
 : public ledgers, AI moderation, strict government access protocols, global health dashboard

## Key Features
### Identity & Access
- **Mandatory ID / Passport Verification**
 : Access to the internet requires real-world identity verification using government-issued documents
- **Biometric Verification**
 : Biometric checks for sensitive content, financial transactions or 18+ access, to ensure the correct user is using the correct account
- **Dual Account System**
 : Each user receives one personal and business account both permanent and verified. unless the business closes, also government proof for business as it will be linked to a government work site (UK) 
- **Digital Human Citizenship**
 : internet accounts are digitally linked to a human identity and citizenship status
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCS)**
 : prove attributes like age, citizenships, employment, and user reputation score, without exposing private data
- **Decentralised Identifiers (DIDS)**
 : Assigns unique public keys to identity anchors

### Content Governance
- **Age-Based Content Access**
 : Content is automatically filtered based on verified age (Vc's)
- **Mandatory content categorisation**
 : all data must be tagged with metadata like age rating, content type, moderation flags
- **Smart content metadata**
 : content metadata included DiD'sm reputation score, moderation history, and more
- **Internet Smart Content**
 : flagged misinformation, rage bait, and junk content are automatically deprioritised

### Data & Security
- **Encrypted Data Storage**
 : every user has a U_ID; all sensitive data is encrypted and stored securely referenced by U_ID
- **Unique Identifier (U_ID)**
 : digital fingerprint. anonymous, permanent, and protected unless the user grants permissions
- **Government Access and Oversight**
 : Government access requires legal procedure and is logged into the public ledger
- **Temporary Access Accounts**
 : refugees or displaced persons can receive a time-limited, geo-bound, read-only access account

### AI & Automation
- **AI-powered Internet management**
 : detects bots, spam, misinformation, and manipulative behaviour
- **Narrow personalised AI assistance**
 : flags misinformation, judges source credibility and reputation score and provides safe content recommendations
- **Decentralised Trust Ledger**
 : Open, tamper-proof, blockchain-free audit trail of identity, moderation and government access
- **Global Cyberhealth Dashboard**
 : Real-time stats on bot outbreaks, fake news, misinformation clusters and moderation health

### Reputation & Transparency
- **User Reputation Scores**
 : track moderation incidents, community contributions, trustworthiness and viewable with consent.
- **Lifetime account management**
 : Accounts cannot be deleted; they are only suspended or restricted. Digital footprints are permanent and monitored

### Integrity & Participation
- **Links to education and work**
 : verified IDs connect to credentials, degrees, workplaces, and certificates
- **Civic participation tools**
 : enables voting, public forums, petitions, and policy engagement through HIP ID
- **Digital Onboarding Courses**
 : required training on digital ethics, safety, consent, misinformation and privacy

## Problems Solved
- Fake accounts and identity fraud
- bot manipulation of public metrics
- children exposed to sensitive content
- platform manipulation via throwaway accounts
- unregulated anonymity and trolling
- barriers to education or civic engagement for the displaced
- trustworthiness of the internet and data
- verifiable information access

## Use Cases
**Scenario 1:** Underage user access attempt
- Content blocked based on verified age

**Scenario 2:** Bot Network Creation
- Blocked By ID verification, and AI behaviour analysis resulting in suspension of the creator

**Scenario 3:** Misinformation Campaign
- Flagged by smart metadata and reputation analysis

**Scenario 4:** SEO or click Fraud by bots
- shut down by AI detectors and pattern recognition, also suspends accounts for suspicious activity

**Scenario 5:** Refugee Needs temporary internet access
- granted geo/time-limited, read-only access

## Future Vision
- **At Birth Digital ID Registration**
 : integrated with national identity systems
- **Hardware ID Devices**
 : Portable, biometric hardware for tamper-resistant login
- **Global Governance Collaboration**
 : international compliance frameworks for ethical data and ID usage
