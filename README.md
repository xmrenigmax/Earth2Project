# Earth2Project     -    The Human-Internet-Protocol (HIP)

## Brief Overivew

HIP is a framework designed to revolutionise the internet. the era of the internet will fall, let a new wave of technology promoting security, eleminating bots, removal of fake accounts, and making malicious automation impossible. By linking physical identity to digital identiy through the use of real-world verifications through verified IDS, passports and later on biometrics for quick usage, HIP aims to create a safer, more accountable and age restricited internet where people are protected, accounted for and monitored for safety


# Key Features
- **Mandatory ID/ Passport verification**   
    : users must verify their identity via government issued documents to access the internet this is done for monitoring users suspicious activity and keeping the internet safe
- **Account System usage**
    : each user holds two accounts, one personal and one business oriented, both linked and permanent, no more accounts can be created or linked.
- **Age-based content access**              
    : automatically filters age restricted content based on age on verified ID,a ensuring protection of children and teenagers on the internet
- **biometric verification**             
    : biometric checks for sensitive content, once logged in and made accounts to ensure identity on viewing content (18+)
- **mandatory content catorgisation**       
    : keeps the internet easy to monitor, and ensures appropriate access for users based on age and content
- **encrypted data storage**               
    : protected privacy of information, all users will be assigned a unique id to protect names, documents and data. heavy encryption will be used (end-to-end)
- **government access with oversight**
    : authorised access only under strict legal and ethical controls, done through a private business account of temporary "government" 
- **lifetime account management**          
    : no accounts should be deleted, or banned, just monitored restricted and suspended based on internet laws of usage
- **Ai-Powered management**
    : block spamming bot detection and internet monitoring

# Motivation 

since 1996 the internet has expaned to 5 billion+ users and an unnumberable amount of sites, being hard to monitor. the majority of which are bots, fake accounts and automised scripts which undermine the integrity of the internet as it skews search results, inflates engagement metrics, monopolises capitalism and creates a toxic online environment.

HIP tackles this by building a foundation where real, accountable humans can participate, where we trust the users, monitor and boost safety and their quality of services they use. the current Internet has limited restrictions based on monopoly, 18+ sites use blatantly redundant age checks, social media flooded with slop, and unfiltered 18+ content, to affect children into addiction of pornography, and the internet filled with fake accounts, bots and fake content and news where bias and propaganda flurish. the age of the "new internet" is over, its time for a replacement, and quick before things rapidly change into uncontrollable, unmonitorable mess. this is the first step to safety and accountability

# Issues Solved
- Bots inflating metrics and manipulating users
- Fake identities spreading misinformation
- Unregulated 18+ content affecting children
- Biased engagement-based algorithms creating toxic feedback loops
- Outdated verification systems like “checkbox” age gates
- Fair internet usage for all individuals, with safety and privacy in check

# Future Visions
- **At-Birth Digital Identity**             
    : integration of national ID systems for a lifetime account and parent monitoring until older age, digital citizenship implemented
- **Biometric Hardware incorporation**     
    : secure, non-spoof authentication keys tied to user biometrics, to ensure safety and identity proper usage of sites and internet usage
- **Global adoption framework**            
    : federated governnance ensuring compliance with different legal environements

# Use Cases
- **Scenario 1:** 
    : 13 year old tries to access 18+ services, or create fake accounts to harrass or fake identity // missinformation
    **solution**
        : HIP compares birth date to site age requirement, automatically blocks
        : can't create fake account, account linked to user pre-designed
        : child is kept safe from site, individual is safe from cyber-harrassment

- **Scenario 2:**
    : an individual with malicious intent tries creating multiple accounts, or spamming bot links
    **solution**
        : HIP detects duplicate identities and blocks access at verification step
        : HIP detects spam of malicious link and scripts
        : user is flagged for monitoring and possible suspension
        : user is restricted

- **Scenario 3:**
    : user tries to upload 18+ services into underaged areas via age restriction dodging
    **solution**
        : HIP detection goes off, checks site age restrictions and cateogory type to compare if its allowed
        : if not allowed HIP suspends user, deletes post, and user is unable to post for punishable amount of time
        : if posted to children sites, punishment might involve legal action as there's no need to promote to children
        : HIP sends details to law enforcement as user has ID linked to account. investigation sent.

- **Scenario 4:**
    : user runs scripts on his account for view count boosting and seo manipulation
    **solution**
        : HIP detection goes off, detects scripts running and mulitple user on one account
        : account suspended for bots and exploiting system
        : account restricted from posting, and commenting, can only view content.

- **Scenario 5:**
    : user has no ID, as refugee.
    **solution**
        : HIP provides lower level access, with restricts for less valid ID methods. potential breaches will result in perm banned under full ID met
        : once full ID received update of account allows user to have full usage of internet access
